# DataScience
The Report can be found in the Data_Science_Final_Project.docx File<br />
<br />
The code for the final project can be found in the Data-Science-Final-Project-Official Folder in a document called Final_Project.ipynb<br />
<br />
IF that file is not working or you would rather go straight to deepnote, the file is also linked within the Data_Science_Final_Project.docx File at the bottom of the document.<br />
<br />
I will also include it right here: https://deepnote.com/workspace/ma-705-1-57c0152d-99a8-43e3-a897-a7e621980d86/project/Data-Science-Final-Project-Official-aa4c38a4-93c5-41d1-843f-4c2dc2bc3205/notebook/Homework-4-fec0044f07fd46a6aa6af1b89c4d0cad?utm_source=share-modal&utm_medium=product-shared-content&utm_campaign=notebook&utm_content=aa4c38a4-93c5-41d1-843f-4c2dc2bc3205 <br />

Happy Grading!<br />
